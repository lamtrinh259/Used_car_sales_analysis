Note: This was the project that was part of the requirements for obtaining a "Data Scientist" certification from Datacamp

# Case Study Project - Used Car Sales
You have been hired as a data scientist at a used car dealership in the UK. The sales team are
having problems with pricing used cars that arrive at the dealership. They would like your
help. To start with, they would like you to work with the Toyota specialist to test your idea(s).
They have collected some data from other retailers on the price that a range of Toyota cars
were listed at. It is known that cars that are more than Â£1500 above the estimated price will
not sell. The sales team wants to know whether you can make predictions within this range.
You will need to present your findings to the Head of Sales, who has no technical data science
background.
